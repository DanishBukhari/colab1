        Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960 –
        25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional football player and <br>
        manager. <br> Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history
        of the sport, he was one of the two <br> joint winners of the FIFA Player of
        the 20th Century award.[3][4] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control,<br>
        and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave <br>
        him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most <br>
        other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great <br>
        effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be <br>
        singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, <br> he
        possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. <br> A
        precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro"
        ("The Golden Boy"), <br> a name that stuck with him throughout his career. <br>
        He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and
        1994 for abusing drugs
