        Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960 –
        25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional football player and
        <br />
        manager. <br />
        Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the
        sport, he was one of the two <br />
        joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.[3][4]
        Maradona's vision, passing, ball control,<br />
        and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave
        <br />
        him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most
        <br />
        other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great
        <br />
        effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be <br />
        singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities,
        <br />
        he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist.
        <br />
        A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro"
        ("The Golden Boy"), <br />
        a name that stuck with him throughout his career. <br />
        He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and
        1994 for abusing drugs
